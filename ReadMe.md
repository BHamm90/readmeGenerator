  ## Description
  While using Node.js and NPM, create an application that will prompt the user questions to answer. When the user has completed the questionaire the application will then build them a readme file.
  
  ## License
  MIT 
  
  ## Installation
  You can install the packages by typing (npm i) in the intergrated terminal.
  
  ## Test
   There are currently no test files attached but you would do this by typing (npm run test) in the integrated terminal.

  ## Usage
  First the user need to right click the main file and select intergrated terminal. After doing so this is when the user will type in (npm i) in order to get the packages for the application to function properly. Now that you have completed that type index.js into the terminal this will start the prompt of the questions array. When complete the application will automatically create you file in the main folder. For example see video in demo folder.

  ## Contributors
  You can contriute by forking the repo polishing the code, add or remove code to make the application more stream line, or simply messaging me with any issue you may run across while using the application. If you do fork when you push the new code back to me I will look into it as soon as possible if used I will make you a contributor.
